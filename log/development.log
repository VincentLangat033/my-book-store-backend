People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.

  Parameters: {"title"=>"Summary and Analysis", "synopsis"=>"Overall Summary of Atomic Habits In Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones, James Clear explains the concept of habits at an atomic level. The book prioritizes habit building over goal setting and outlines various pros and cons of the two. Instead of making massive changes in any particular area, a greater effect can be reached by making numerous small changes. In place of one big 10% improvement, you can make dozens of small 1% improvements that when added together have a much larger impact. The book breaks down the 4 steps of habits: cue, craving, response, and reward, and then further explains the psychology behind why habits hold so much power. The book goes into considerable detail for both how to develop and stick with positive habits, and how to identify and shake off bad habits. Not every positive habit is without flaws. There can be unexpected downsides, even to outright mastery. James Clear elucidates a number of ways to keep positive habits from stagnating and keep your priorities in focus. The goal of a positive habit is to have it eventually become automatic. The way to achieve habit automation is through repetition. A habit will never become automatic through the passage of time alone. There are a number of techniques and strategies that can be employed in habit development, and even technology can play an important role in sticking with a positive habit.

In place of one big 10% improvement, you can make dozens of small 1% improvements that when added together have a much larger impact. The book breaks down the 4 steps of habits: cue, craving, response, and reward, and then further explains the psychology behind why habits hold so much power. The book goes into considerable detail for both how to develop and stick with positive habits, and how to identify and shake off bad habits. Not every positive habit is without flaws. There can be unexpected downsides, even to outright mastery. James Clear elucidates a number of ways to keep positive habits from stagnating and keep your priorities in focus. The goal of a positive habit is to have it eventually become automatic. The way to achieve habit automation is through repetition. A habit will never become automatic through the passage of time alone. There are a number of techniques and strategies that can be employed in habit development, and even technology can play an important role in sticking with a positive habit.

The narrative is rich with stories and anecdotes, which not only inspire, but also show a way forward to take action. After all, riches are not just material, but also pertaining to the mind, body and spirit.

Author Napoleon Hill claims to have based this book on twenty years of rigorous research on the lives of those who had amassed great wealth and made a fortune. Observing their habits, their ways of working and the principles they followed, Hill put together laws and philosophies that can be practiced in everyday life to achieve all-round success. The narrative is rich with stories and anecdotes, which not only inspire, but also show a way forward to take action. After all, riches are not just material, but also pertaining to the mind, body and spirit.

  Parameters: {"title"=>"Atomic Habits", "synopsis"=>"THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now. People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy. These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life. ________________________________ A NEW YORK TIMES AND SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER 'A supremely practical and useful book.' Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck 'James Clear has spent years honing the art and studying the science of habits. This engaging, hands-on book is the guide you need to break bad routines and make good ones.' Adam Grant, author of Originals 'Atomic Habits is a step-by-step manual for changing routines.'

  Parameters: {"title"=>"Think and Grow Rich", "synopsis"=>"Think and Grow Rich has been called the \"Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature.\" It was the first book to boldly ask, \"What makes a winner?\" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself. The most famous of all teachers of success spent \"a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort\" to produce the \"Law of Success\" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one. In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers.", "image_url"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0eLbDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "author"=>"Napoleon Hill", "genre"=>"Self-Help"}

  Parameters: {"title"=>"Atomic Habits", "synopsis"=>"THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now. People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy. These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life. ________________________________ A NEW YORK TIMES AND SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER 'A supremely practical and useful book.' Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck 'James Clear has spent years honing the art and studying the science of habits.
